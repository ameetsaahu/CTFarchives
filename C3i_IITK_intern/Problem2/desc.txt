Problem Statement: Write a Python code to read a file (input.txt) containing a list of URLs and
then read files from an URL and do some processing as mentioned further on the file data. A user
reads from a URL should be a JSON file; else, the program should give an output warning stating
that the “file is not a JSON file” and exit. The code should only consider proper/standard URLs as
an input, and if it is not a valid URL, then the program should give an output warning stating that
the “URL is incorrect” and exit. The JSON file which the code will read has a standard format --
Student name:

with an overall grade in the semester as a label - Exceptional, Very Good, Good, Fair, and Poor. The
user has to apply any feature reduction algorithm like PCA and then perform classification into
these classes ( Exceptional, Very Good, Good, Fair, and Poor). And also mention accuracy and the
False Positive Rate (FPR) using cross-validation.
Final deliverables:
1. Python code named as “program.py”
2. A text file containing named as “output.txt” accuracy and the False Positive Rate (FPR)
using cross-validation for your model.
Evaluation criteria:
We will test your code on the unlabeled student data. Your code should take the input file that
contains testing URLs as a command-line argument, and the output should be in a CSV file.
Example -
Command Line - $ python program.py "input.txt"
Predicted Output in CSV:
StudentName1, Good
StudentName2, Poor
